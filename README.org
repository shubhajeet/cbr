* CBR (Case Based Reasoning)
  This project aims to implement a simplistic Case Based Reasoning system to evaluate the health of the system and suggest a solution.
  
** Structure of Knowledge Base
  - symptoms :: directory containing script that detects symptoms from the system output .toml file
  - case :: directory containing toml describing the case
  - solutions :: directory containing script to solve the case
  
* Syntax
#+BEGIN_SRC bahs
$ python cbr/cbr.py -h
usage: cbr.py [-h] {check,diagnose,treat} ...

Case Based Reasoning Assistance

positional arguments:
  {check,diagnose,treat}
    check               check sub-command help
    diagnose            diagnose sub-command help
    treat               treat sub-command help

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
#+END_SRC

** Example Case
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[symptoms]
integer=5
string="my string"
bool=true

[solution]
script="solution1.sh"
#+END_SRC

** Example symptoms
Here is a dummy symptoms example.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/usr/env bash
echo "integer=4"
echo "string='my string'"
echo "bool=true"
#+END_SRC
The most important part of the above script is that it should output the key value pair in toml syntax.
